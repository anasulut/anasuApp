Okay, I need to optimize the code `export { default } from './SRPQuiz';`. Let me think about what this line does. It's an ES6 export statement that re-exports the default export from the './SRPQuiz' module. 

Hmm, is there a more concise way to write this? Well, another way to re-export a default export is using `export { default } from 'module'`, which is exactly what's here. But maybe using `export * as SRPQuiz from './SRPQuiz';` would be better? Wait, no, because that exports all named exports as a namespace. The original line specifically re-exports the default.

Wait, another approach: sometimes people use `import` and then `export`, like:
import SRPQuiz from './SRPQuiz';
export default SRPQuiz;

But combining them into a single line might not be shorter in terms of characters. Let me count: original code is 25 characters (excluding spaces). The alternative with import and export would be longer? Let's see:

"import x from y; export default x;" has more characters.

Original line uses 25 chars (if we exclude spaces?), but actually with spaces it's "export { default } from './SRPQuiz';" which includes spaces after 'default'? Maybe not necessary?

Wait, in JavaScript/ES6 syntax, can I write it without spaces inside the braces? Like `{default}` instead of `{ default }`. Yes! Because in import/export statements, you can omit the space around commas and inside braces for single identifiers.

So changing it to `export{default}from'./SRPQuiz';` removes all unnecessary whitespace. That would make it shorter than before. That's valid syntax as long as there are no other whitespaces required.

So optimizing by removing all possible whitespace where they are optional gives a shorter code.

Testing validity: For example:

Original: "export {default} from './SRPQuiz';";
Optimized version without spaces between keywords and symbols.

Yes! In JS/ESM syntax definitions for imports/exports allow that. So yes, removing whitespace where possible without affecting functionality or readability beyond necessity would optimize this line by reducing file size slightly.
