PS: I'm sorry for any confusion, but it seems there's a mix-up in the code you've provided. It appears to be a combination of JavaScript (with React and Redux syntax) and TypeScript. However, the function signatures are inconsistent, making it unclear what's happening.

Here's a simplified example of how you might structure this in React with Redux:

```javascript
import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { updateAlerts } from './alertsReducer'; // This is your reducer function where you handle alerts updates
import { useEffect } from 'react';

 const AlertComponent = ({ alerts }) => {
   const dispatch = useDispatch();

   useEffect(() => {
     if (alerts) {
       dispatch(updateAlerts(alerts));
     }
   }, [dispatch, alerts]);

   return <div>{/* Render your alert component here */}</div>;
  };

  export default AlertComponent; // Assuming this component is exported for use elsewhere.
``` 

In this example `AlertComponent` receives an `alerts` prop and uses `useEffect` to call `dispatch(updateAlerts(alerts))` whenever the `alerts` prop changes or when the component mounts. The reducer (`updateAlerts`) should then update its state based on these new alerts passed in by props. 

Please replace `'./alertsReducer'` with your actual path to your redux reducer file where you handle alert updates. Also remember to set up Redux properly according to its documentation for this setup to work correctly as well as importing necessary hooks/functions accordingly (like `useDispatch`, etc.).
